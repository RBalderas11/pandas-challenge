    "Observation 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "An analysis was conducted by comparing the math and reading scores of students at district schools versus charter schools. Student scores and the funds allocated for each student were used for the comparsion. Once compiling the data, a clear difference jumped out between the charter schools and the district schools. When we review the average math score and average reading score, charter scores outperformed the district schools. There was a 36 point difference in overall passing score with charter schools having an overall passing of 90.43% and district schools having an overall passing score of 53.67%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation 2 and 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Another observation made that could impact the difference in scores is the number of students at each school. Charter schools had students under 1500 while district schools had over 2000 students. Resources and attention from teachers are more difficult when they have more students. Students who need additional help can end up not being seen due to the sheer number of students. Charter school students are able to be in smaller classes and have more 1 on 1 attention from students. \n",
    "Another observation that can be made is the amount of money spent for each student based on the type of school. The better performing schools are spending more per student than the bottom performing students. While it can be difficult to make a direct tie due to how the money is allocated, the data would indicate that there is a connection between money set aside for resources for the students and how well they perform.
