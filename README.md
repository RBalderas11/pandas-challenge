# pandas-challenge
For the Pandas challenge, we were asked to analyze students' reading and math scores at charter and district scores. By utilizing pandas, we were able to create dataframes
to perform math equations as well as create new tables.

To complete this challenge, I utilized my tutor as well as my classmates. I asked about being able to show the tables and how to perform the math equations.

I rewatched our pandas classes and utilized our previous class assignments to write out the code.

There were several times that I had to google, especially when debugging. I researched solutions on Stack Overflow as well as other Python websites.
